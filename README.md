## Next Steps
1. I would like to make the website more reactive. Apart from bettering the styling, I plan to do this by have each pet name, user name displayed to redirect to the user/pet profile.
2. I would like to add like buttons for each post
3. I would also like to add API that helps determine the breeds when a photo is submitted.
